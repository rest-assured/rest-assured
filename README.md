Testing and validation of REST services in Java is harder than in dynamic languages 
such as Ruby and Groovy. REST Assured brings the simplicity of using these 
languages into the Java domain.

## Examples
Here's an example of how to make a GET request and validate the JSON or XML response:

```java
get("/lotto").then().assertThat().body("lotto.lottoId", equalTo(5));
```

Get and verify all winner ids:

```java
get("/lotto").then().assertThat().body("lotto.winners.winnerId", hasItems(23, 54));
```

Using parameters:

```java
given().
    param("key1", "value1").
    param("key2", "value2").
when().
    post("/somewhere").
then().
    body(containsString("OK"));
```

Using X-Path (XML only):

```java
given().
    params("firstName", "John", "lastName", "Doe").
when().
    post("/greetMe").
then().
    body(hasXPath("/greeting/firstName[text()='John']")).
```

Need authentication? REST Assured provides several authentication mechanisms:

```java
given().auth().basic(username, password).when().get("/secured").then().statusCode(200);
```

Getting and parsing a response body:

```java
// Example with JsonPath
String json = get("/lotto").asString();
List<String> winnerIds = from(json).get("lotto.winners.winnerId");
    
// Example with XmlPath
String xml = post("/shopping").andReturn().body().asString();
Node category = from(xml).get("shopping.category[0]");
```

REST Assured supports any HTTP method but has explicit support for *POST*, *GET*, *PUT*, *DELETE*, *OPTIONS*, *PATCH* and *HEAD* and includes specifying and validating e.g. parameters, headers, cookies and body easily.
